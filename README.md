# Data-Visualisation-using-Seaborn-Pandas
A personal project where I utilized the UCI Breast Cancer dataset and performed EDA on the same, Identified and interpreted inherent quantitative relationships in datasets,  Produced and customized various chart types with Seaborn in Python

These are the followimg steps that I followed in order to complete the project:
1. Got familiar with the data set and imported it
2. Separated the Target from Features
3. Diagnosis Distribution Visualization
4. Visualizing Standardized Data with Seaborn
5. Violin Plots and Box Plots
6. Usec Joint Plots for Feature Comparison
7. Observing Distributions and their Variance with Swarm Plots
8. Obtaining all Pairwise Correlations
